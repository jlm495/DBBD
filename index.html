            <h2>What is Dirt Bike Break Down?</h2>
            <p id="pitch">We've all seen those dirt bike scenes in movies and TV that make riders roll their eyes - unrealistic jumps, impossible stunts, and cringe-worthy riding techniques. Dirt Bike Break Down is the podcast and video series that will fearlessly dissect every dirt bike moment on screen. We aim to bring the real rider's perspective to Hollywood's two-wheeled adventures. Track or trails, blockbuster or indie film - no dirt bike scene is safe!</p>

            <p>Jordan is a self-described “intermediate” rider with a passion for motocross and a history of dabbling in trail riding. She's raced hare scrambles and motocross alike, with more experience in the former. She loves ripping her 2019 Yamaha yz250f and working on her “steez”, however she is currently coming off of a crash that resulted in 2 broken tibias after not even a full year recovering from 2 obliterated ankles in what some might call a higher power's sense of humor on full display.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In this trio, Shawna is the experienced, well-seasoned (if scars count as seasoning), advanced rider and big sister. Racing enduro, hare scrambles, motocross, and even a couple UTV races, it's safe to call her multi-faceted. Although she loves any opportunity to challenge her skills on her 2020 Yamaha yz250, she has recently changed her focus to coaching and single track enduro after a recent head injury and liver laceration.</p>

            <p>Jenna is the nerdy sister and resident “T-Rex” of the three (according to Jordan), responsible for the Physics Break Down segments in each episode. Although she mostly has experience in motocross, she is excited to try her hand at trail riding this summer. She also has brief experience racing, having done a few hare scrambles. She is a beginner rider, currently working on improving her body positioning and control in an attempt to tame her 2014 Yamaha yz250f.</p>
